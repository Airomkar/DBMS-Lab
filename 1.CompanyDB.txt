SOLUTION-- 
            
Step 1: Create Database

CREATE DATABASE company;
USE company;

Step 2: Create Tables

CREATE TABLE dept (
  deptno INT PRIMARY KEY,
  deptname VARCHAR(30),
  location VARCHAR(30)
);

CREATE TABLE emp (
  eno INT PRIMARY KEY,
  ename VARCHAR(30),
  job VARCHAR(20),
  hiredate DATE,
  salary DECIMAL(10,2),
  commission DECIMAL(10,2),
  deptno INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (deptno) REFERENCES dept(deptno)
);

Step 3: Insert Sample Data

INSERT INTO dept VALUES
(10, 'Sales', 'Mumbai'),
(20, 'Dev', 'Pune'),
(30, 'HR', 'Delhi');

INSERT INTO emp VALUES
(101, 'Isha', 'Salesman', '1981-09-15', 2500, 300, 10),
(102, 'Amit', 'Manager', '1982-05-20', 3500, NULL, 20),
(103, 'Imran', 'Clerk', '1981-06-25', 1500, NULL, 20),
(104, 'Ravi', 'Salesman', '1983-01-10', 2200, 200, 10),
(105, 'Sneha', 'Analyst', '1980-11-12', 4000, NULL, 20),
(106, 'Priya', 'HR', '1984-07-15', 1800, NULL, 30);

SELECT * FROM emp;
SELECT * FROM dept;

FROM emp
ORDER BY salary DESC;

5. List of no. of emp & avg salary for emp in the dept no ‘20’

SELECT COUNT(*) AS No_of_Employees,
       AVG(salary) AS Avg_Salary
FROM emp
WHERE deptno = 20;

6. List the avg salary, minimum salary of the emp hiredatewise for dept no ‘10’. 

SELECT hiredate,
       AVG(salary) AS Avg_Salary,
       MIN(salary) AS Min_Salary
FROM emp
WHERE deptno = 10
GROUP BY hiredate;

7. List emp name and its department

SELECT e.ename, d.deptname
FROM emp e
JOIN dept d ON e.deptno = d.deptno;

8. List total salary paid to each department 

SELECT d.deptname, SUM(e.salary) AS Total_Salary
FROM emp e
JOIN dept d ON e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY d.deptname;

9. List details of employee working in ‘Dev’ department 

SELECT e.*
FROM emp e
JOIN dept d ON e.deptno = d.deptno
WHERE d.deptname = 'Dev';

10. Update salary of all employees in deptno 10 by 5 %. 

UPDATE emp
SET salary = salary * 1.05

| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | What is the use of `PRIMARY KEY`?                            | It uniquely identifies each record in a table and does not allow NULL or duplicate values.                                 |
| 2        | What is a `FOREIGN KEY`?                                     | It creates a relationship between two tables and enforces referential integrity.                                           |
| 3        | Difference between `DELETE`, `DROP`, and `TRUNCATE`?         | `DELETE` removes rows, `TRUNCATE` removes all rows quickly, `DROP` deletes the entire table.                               |
| 4        | What is the purpose of `LIKE` operator?                      | It is used for pattern matching in SQL (e.g., `LIKE 'I%'` finds names starting with I).                                    |
| 5        | What does `ORDER BY salary DESC` mean?                       | It arranges the rows in descending order based on the salary column.                                                       |
| 6        | What is the use of `GROUP BY`?                               | It groups rows that have the same values in specified columns, often used with aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`.  |
| 7        | What is the difference between `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`? | `INNER JOIN` shows only matching records, while `LEFT JOIN` shows all records from the left table even if no match exists. |
| 8        | What is `AVG()` function used for?                           | It calculates the average value of a numeric column.                                                                       |
| 9        | What data type is used for storing dates?                    | The `DATE` data type.                                                                                                      |
| 10       | How to update salary by a percentage?                        | Use `UPDATE emp SET salary = salary * 1.05 WHERE deptno = 10;` to increase by 5%.                                          |
| 11       | What is the purpose of `WHERE` clause?                       | It is used to filter records based on specific conditions.                                                                 |
| 12       | What does `MAX()` and `MIN()` do?                            | `MAX()` returns the largest value, and `MIN()` returns the smallest value in a column.                                     |
| 13       | Can a table have more than one primary key?                  | No, a table can have only one primary key, but it can contain multiple columns (composite key).                            |
| 14       | What is the default sorting order in SQL?                    | Ascending order (ASC) is the default sorting order.                                                                        |
| 15       | Why do we use aliases like `e` and `d` in joins?             | To make SQL queries shorter and easier to read, especially when using multiple tables.                                     |
