SOLUTION-- 
            
Step 1: Create Database

CREATE DATABASE company;
USE company;

Step 2: Create Tables

CREATE TABLE dept (
  deptno INT PRIMARY KEY,
  deptname VARCHAR(30),
  location VARCHAR(30)
);

CREATE TABLE emp (
  eno INT PRIMARY KEY,
  ename VARCHAR(30),
  job VARCHAR(20),
  hiredate DATE,
  salary DECIMAL(10,2),
  commission DECIMAL(10,2),
  deptno INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (deptno) REFERENCES dept(deptno)
);

Step 3: Insert Sample Data

INSERT INTO dept VALUES
(10, 'Sales', 'Mumbai'),
(20, 'Dev', 'Pune'),
(30, 'HR', 'Delhi');

INSERT INTO emp VALUES
(101, 'Isha', 'Salesman', '1981-09-15', 2500, 300, 10),

(103, 'Imran', 'Clerk', '1981-06-25', 1500, NULL, 20),
(104, 'Ravi', 'Salesman', '1983-01-10', 2200, 200, 10),
(105, 'Sneha', 'Analyst', '1980-11-12', 4000, NULL, 20),
(106, 'Priya', 'HR', '1984-07-15', 1800, NULL, 30);

SELECT * FROM emp;
SELECT * FROM dept;
