Solution -- 

Step 1: Create Database

CREATE DATABASE BankDB;
USE BankDB;

Step 2: Create Tables

CREATE TABLE Branch (
  bname VARCHAR(30) PRIMARY KEY,
  city VARCHAR(30)
);

CREATE TABLE Customers (
  cname VARCHAR(30) PRIMARY KEY,
  city VARCHAR(30)
);

CREATE TABLE Deposit (
  actno INT PRIMARY KEY,
  cname VARCHAR(30),
  bname VARCHAR(30),
  amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  adate DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (cname) REFERENCES Customers(cname),
  FOREIGN KEY (bname) REFERENCES Branch(bname)
);

CREATE TABLE Borrow (
  loanno INT PRIMARY KEY,
  cname VARCHAR(30),
  bname VARCHAR(30),
  amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  FOREIGN KEY (cname) REFERENCES Customers(cname),
  FOREIGN KEY (bname) REFERENCES Branch(bname)
);

Step 3: Insert Sample Data

INSERT INTO Branch VALUES
('KAROLBAGH', 'Delhi'),
('FC Road', 'Pune'),
('MG Road', 'Mumbai');

INSERT INTO Customers VALUES
('Anil', 'Pune'),
('Sneha', 'Mumbai'),
('Sunil', 'Delhi'),
('Ravi', 'Pune');

INSERT INTO Deposit VALUES
(101, 'Anil', 'KAROLBAGH', 5000, '1997-01-10'),
(102, 'Sneha', 'MG Road', 3500, '1997-02-12'),
(103, 'Sunil', 'KAROLBAGH', 4500, '1996-12-15'),
(104, 'Ravi', 'FC Road', 6000, '1997-03-08');

INSERT INTO Borrow VALUES
(201, 'Anil', 'KAROLBAGH', 2000),
(202, 'Ravi', 'FC Road', 3000),
(203, 'Sneha', 'MG Road', 4000);

🧾 SQL QUERIES AND ANSWERS

| 1        | What is a **Primary Key**?                                       | A field that uniquely identifies each record in a table.                                                  |
| 2        | What is a **Foreign Key**?                                       | A field that links one table to another to maintain referential integrity.                                |
| 3        | What is the purpose of the **ALTER TABLE** command?              | To change the structure of an existing table (e.g., modify column size, add or delete columns).           |
| 4        | What is the use of **COUNT()** function?                         | It counts the number of rows that match a condition.                                                      |
| 5        | What is a **View** in SQL?                                       | A virtual table created using a query to simplify data access.                                            |
| 6        | What does `DELETE FROM table WHERE condition` do?                | It deletes rows that meet the condition.                                                                  |
| 7        | What happens if you omit the `WHERE` clause in a `DELETE` query? | All records in the table will be deleted.                                                                 |
| 8        | What is the difference between **ALTER** and **UPDATE**?         | `ALTER` changes the table structure; `UPDATE` modifies data inside the table.                             |
| 9        | What is a **tuple** in SQL?                                      | A single row in a table is called a tuple.                                                                |
| 10       | What is the use of `CREATE VIEW`?                                | It creates a reusable, virtual representation of data from one or more tables.                            |
| 11       | Can a view contain data from multiple tables?                    | Yes, by using joins inside the `CREATE VIEW` statement.                                                   |
| 12       | What is the purpose of the `WHERE` clause?                       | To filter records based on specific conditions.                                                           |
| 13       | What is the difference between **DROP** and **DELETE**?          | `DROP` removes the entire table, while `DELETE` removes only data.                                        |
| 14       | What is a **constraint**?                                        | A rule applied to a table column to maintain data accuracy and integrity (like PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY). |
| 15       | Why do we need foreign keys?                                     | To link tables logically and prevent invalid data entry by enforcing referential integrity.               |
