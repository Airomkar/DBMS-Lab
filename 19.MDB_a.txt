Solution -- 

Step 1: Create and Use Database

use DYPIT

Step 2: Create Collections and Insert Data

(a) Teachers Collection

db.Teachers.insertMany([
  { Tname: "Praveen", dno: 1, dname: "COMP", experience: 5, salary: 12000, date_of_joining: "2018-06-10" },
  { Tname: "Rajesh", dno: 2, dname: "IT", experience: 8, salary: 15000, date_of_joining: "2016-03-14" },
  { Tname: "Sonal", dno: 3, dname: "E&TC", experience: 6, salary: 11000, date_of_joining: "2019-08-21" },
  { Tname: "Meena", dno: 4, dname: "COMP", experience: 4, salary: 9500, date_of_joining: "2020-11-01" }
])

(b) Students Collection

db.Students.insertMany([
  { Sname: "Amit", roll_no: 1, class: "FE" },
  { Sname: "XYZ", roll_no: 2, class: "SE" },
  { Sname: "Rohit", roll_no: 3, class: "TE" }
])

🧩 Queries

1️⃣ Find information about all teachers

db.Teachers.find().pretty()

2️⃣ Find all teachers of Computer department

db.Teachers.find({ dname: "COMP" }).pretty()

3️⃣ Find all teachers of Computer, IT, and E&TC department

db.Teachers.find({ dname: { $in: ["COMP", "IT", "E&TC"] } }).pretty()

4️⃣ Find teachers of Computer, IT, and E&TC department having salary ≥ 10000

db.Teachers.find({
  dname: { $in: ["COMP", "IT", "E&TC"] },
  salary: { $gte: 10000 }
}).pretty()

5️⃣ Find student info having roll_no = 2 or Sname = 'xyz'

db.Students.find({
  $or: [{ roll_no: 2 }, { Sname: "xyz" }]
}).pretty()

6️⃣ Update experience of teacher Praveen to 10 years

db.Teachers.updateOne(
  { Tname: "Praveen" },
  { $set: { experience: 10, dno: 1, dname: "COMP", salary: 12000, date_of_joining: "2018-06-10" } },
  { upsert: true }
)

7️⃣ Update department of all teachers working in IT department to COMP

db.Teachers.updateMany(
  { dname: "IT" },
  { $set: { dname: "COMP" } }
)

8️⃣ Find teacher name and experience only

db.Teachers.find({}, { Tname: 1, experience: 1, _id: 0 })

9️⃣ Using save() method insert one entry in department collection

db.department.save({ dno: 5, dname: "Mechanical" })

    TypeError: db.department.save is not a function
    db.department.insertOne({ dno: 5, dname: "Mechanical" })

🔟 Using save() method change the dept of teacher Rajesh to IT

teacher = db.Teachers.findOne({ Tname: "Rajesh" })
teacher.dname = "IT"
db.Teachers.save(teacher)

    TypeError: db.department.save is not a function
    db.Teachers.updateOne(
      { Tname: "Rajesh" },          // condition
      { $set: { dname: "IT" } }     // update operation
    )

1️⃣1️⃣ Delete all documents from Teachers collection having IT dept

db.Teachers.deleteMany({ dname: "IT" })

1️⃣2️⃣ Display with pretty(), the first 3 documents in ascending order

db.Teachers.find().sort({ Tname: 1 }).limit(3).pretty()

| 2         | What is a Collection in MongoDB?                         | A collection is similar to a table in SQL; it stores multiple documents.                               |
| 3         | What is a Document in MongoDB?                           | A document is a single record in MongoDB represented in JSON format.                                   |
| 4         | Difference between insertOne() and insertMany()?         | `insertOne()` inserts one document, while `insertMany()` inserts multiple documents at once.           |
| 5         | What is pretty() in MongoDB?                             | It displays documents in a more readable, formatted style.                                             |
| 6         | What does `$gte` mean?                                   | `$gte` means "greater than or equal to" in MongoDB query conditions.                                   |
| 7         | What is `$in` operator used for?                         | `$in` matches any of the values specified in an array (like OR condition).                             |
| 8         | What is the use of `updateOne()` and `updateMany()`?     | `updateOne()` updates only the first matching document; `updateMany()` updates all matching documents. |
| 9         | What is `upsert`?                                        | `upsert: true` creates a new document if no matching document exists.                                  |
| 10        | What is `save()` method used for?                        | `save()` inserts a new document or replaces an existing one if `_id` matches.                          |
| 11        | What is difference between deleteOne() and deleteMany()? | `deleteOne()` deletes one matching document, while `deleteMany()` deletes all matching documents.      |
| 12        | How to sort documents?                                   | Using `.sort({ fieldname: 1 })` for ascending or `-1` for descending order.                            |
| 13        | What is the default data format used in MongoDB?         | BSON (Binary JSON).                                                                                    |
| 14        | How is MongoDB different from SQL?                       | MongoDB is schema-less and stores data as JSON documents, while SQL uses fixed table schemas.          |
| 15        | What is use of `limit()`?                                | It limits the number of documents returned by a query.                                                 |
