Solution -- 

Step 1: Create Database

CREATE DATABASE projectDB;
USE projectDB;

Step 2: Create Tables

CREATE TABLE Project (
  Project_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
  Proj_name VARCHAR(50),
  Chief_arch VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Employee (
  Emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Emp_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Assigned_To (
  Project_id VARCHAR(10),
  Emp_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (Project_id) REFERENCES Project(Project_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (Emp_id) REFERENCES Employee(Emp_id)
);

Step 3: Insert Sample Data

INSERT INTO Project VALUES
('C353', 'Database Project', 'Amit Sharma'),
('C354', 'Web App Development', 'Ravi Kumar'),
('C453', 'AI Research', 'Sneha Patil');

INSERT INTO Employee VALUES
(101, 'John'),
(102, 'Meera'),
(103, 'Ravi'),
(104, 'Aditi'),
(105, 'Raj');

INSERT INTO Assigned_To VALUES
('C353', 101),
('C353', 102),
('C353', 103),
('C354', 103),
('C354', 104),
('C453', 105);

🧾 SQL QUERIES AND ANSWERS

 1. Get the details of employees working on project C353

WHERE a.Project_id = 'C353';

2. Get employee number of employees working on project C353

SELECT COUNT(Emp_id) AS No_of_Employees
FROM Assigned_To

3. Obtain details of employees working on Database project

SELECT e.Emp_id, e.Emp_name
FROM Employee e
JOIN Assigned_To a ON e.Emp_id = a.Emp_id
JOIN Project p ON a.Project_id = p.Project_id
WHERE p.Proj_name = 'Database Project';

4. Get details of employees working on both C353 and C354

SELECT e.Emp_id, e.Emp_name
FROM Employee e
WHERE e.Emp_id IN (
    SELECT Emp_id FROM Assigned_To WHERE Project_id = 'C353'
)
AND e.Emp_id IN (
    SELECT Emp_id FROM Assigned_To WHERE Project_id = 'C354'
);

5. Get employee numbers of employees who do not work on project C453

SELECT Emp_id
FROM Employee
WHERE Emp_id NOT IN (

| 1        | What is a **Primary Key**?                                       | A unique identifier for each record in a table.                                                                          |

| 3        | Why do we use **JOIN** in SQL?                                   | To combine data from two or more related tables based on a common column.                                                |
| 4        | What is the difference between **INNER JOIN** and **LEFT JOIN**? | `INNER JOIN` returns only matching records; `LEFT JOIN` returns all records from the left table even if no match exists. |
| 5        | What does the `IN` operator do?                                  | It checks if a value exists in a list or subquery result.                                                                |
| 6        | What is the purpose of `NOT IN`?                                 | To exclude records that match a condition in a subquery or list.                                                         |
| 7        | How does the `COUNT()` function work?                            | It counts the number of rows that meet a specified condition.                                                            |
| 8        | What is the role of the **Assigned_To** table in this database?  | It connects employees with projects (many-to-many relationship).                                                         |
| 9        | What is a **Subquery**?                                          | A query inside another query, used to filter or calculate results dynamically.                                           |
| 10       | What is a **relational database**?                               | A database that organizes data into tables linked by relationships.                                                      |
| 11       | Can one employee work on multiple projects?                      | Yes, because of the many-to-many relationship through Assigned_To.                                                       |
| 12       | Why is Project_id made a primary key in Project table?           | To uniquely identify each project.                                                                                       |
